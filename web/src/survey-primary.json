I was actually involved in a case where this exact thing happened and the beneficiary under the will (actually the co-beneficiary) successfully argued that his brother (who owned the house in joint tenancy with the mother) held the house as trustee for the estate.  I.e. that the mom put the house in joint tenancy for reasons other than to give the house solely to the one son.    \n- same FAQ as Tyler 1"
